## Creating a Project with .NET CLI

Follow these steps to create a solution and add a console project in Visual Studio Code using the .NET CLI.

---

### 1. Install the .NET SDK
Verify if the .NET SDK is installed by running the command:

```bash 
dotnet --version
```
If the command outputs a version number, the SDK is installed. If not, download and install it from the official .NET website.

---

### 2. Create a Solution (.sln)
1. Open your terminal and navigate to the directory where you want to create the solution.
2. Run the command to create a new solution:

     ```bash 
     dotnet new sln -n YourSolutionName
     ```

---

### 3. Create a Console Project
1. Navigate to the solution directory or a subdirectory.
2. Run the command to create a console project:

     ```bash 
     dotnet new console -n YourProjectName
     ```

     This will generate a folder named after your project, containing the necessary files.

---

### 4. Add the Project to the Solution
1. Return to the root of your solution (where the `.sln` file is located).
2. Use the command to add the console project to the solution:

     ```bash 
     dotnet sln add YourProjectName/YourProjectName.csproj
     ```

---

### 5. Open the Project in Visual Studio Code
1. Open the project in Visual Studio Code using the command:

     ```bash 
     code .
     ```

2. Ensure that the **C# Extension Pack** is installed in Visual Studio Code to enable IntelliSense and additional features.

---

### 6. Restore and Run the Project
1. Restore the required packages by running the command:

     ```bash 
     dotnet restore
     ```

2. Run the project to test using the command:

     ```bash 
     dotnet run --project YourProjectName
     ```

## Example Code
Hereâ€™s a simple example of C# code to get started:
```csharp
using System;

class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Hello, world from C#!");
    }
}
