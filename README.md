# C-sharp
C# (pronounced "C-sharp") is a modern, object-oriented programming language developed by Microsoft, designed to run on the .NET platform. It combines the power of C++ with the simplicity of Visual Basic, making it versatile for a wide range of applications, including web, desktop, mobile, gaming, and cloud services.
